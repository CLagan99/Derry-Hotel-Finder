        <p class="about-info">Derry Hotel Finder is a hotel locator website used to help people search for the best offers given by various hotels located through the City of Derry. The website aims to create an easier way for users to search for the best and affordable prices the hotels can offer. It also aims to provide a wide range of activities for both family and friends, from going on a shopping spree in our most popular Folyeside and Richmond Shopping Centres to exploring the cityâ€™s historic attractions and its fascinating murals.<br><br>
            Created in 2022, the Derry Hotel Finder website offers its users a simpler way of not only getting right prices for choosing a hotel but also provide background details the hotels history and what they can offer for its users as well as directions. Even though Derry is the second largest city in Northern Ireland, it still can be difficult for people to navigate throughout the city and arrive at the hotel they are looking for.</p>
